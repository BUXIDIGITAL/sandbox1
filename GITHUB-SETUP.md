# üöÄ Push to GitHub - Quick Guide

Your code is committed locally! Now let's push it to GitHub.

## Option 1: Using GitHub Website (Easiest)

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the **"+"** icon (top right) ‚Üí **"New repository"**
3. Repository name: `resume-builder` (or your choice)
4. Description: `Professional resume builder with PDF export`
5. Choose **Public** or **Private**
6. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (we already have one)
7. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Push Your Code
GitHub will show you commands. Copy and run these in your terminal:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/resume-builder.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### Step 3: Verify
Refresh your GitHub repository page - you should see all your files!
